# password_strength_checker
Project Overview

The Password Strength Checker is a security-focused application that evaluates the strength of user passwords based on predefined rules. It helps users create stronger passwords by analyzing length, character variety, and common security weaknesses, thereby improving overall cybersecurity awareness.

This project is especially useful for beginners learning about authentication security and secure password practices.

Objectives

	•	To check the strength of a given password
	•	To classify passwords as Weak, Medium, or Strong
	•	To promote secure password creation
	•	To understand basic security validation techniques
